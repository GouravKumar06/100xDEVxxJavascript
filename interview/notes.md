**Data types**
```In JavaScript, "datatypes" mean the kind of value a variable can hold.```

number
string
boolean
undefined
null
symbol
bigINT
objects(array)

**difference == and === ??**
``equality(==) performs type coercian before comparison it only compares value``
``strict equality(===) does not performs type coercian before comparison it compare both value and type``


**Null vs Undefined**
```Undefined represents a variable that has been declared but not initialise```

```Null must be exiplicitly assigned. Type of NUll is object(this is a known javascript bug)```
